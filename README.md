Delphi-Textfiles Development
In Gr11 we did Textfiles in Delphi witch changed my perspective of coding in IT.
The Code shown was how to reverse every line in a textfile.

The problem required me to use all the programming of textfiles and loops i had learnd and also use new Objects (Openfile Dialogs) and Functions (AnsiReverseString).
The struggle of slowly realising i needed two textfiles and two strings helped my brain realise how to program with an end goal in mind.
